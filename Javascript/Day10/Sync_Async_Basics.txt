JavaScript Synchronous vs Asynchronous Programming

Synchronous Code:
Synchronous code runs step by step and waits for each task to finish.

Ex:- (Synchronous)
console.log("A");
console.log("B");
console.log("C");
Output: A, B, C (in order)


Asynchronous Code:
Asynchronous code runs tasks in the background without stopping the main program.

Ex:-(Asynchronous)
console.log("A");
setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("B");
}, 1000);
console.log("C");
Output: A, C, B (B runs after 1 second)


Blocking Code & Execution:
Blocking code stops program execution until the task is completed.

Ex:-(Blocking)
while(true) {
  // Infinite loop (blocks program)
}
console.log("Hello"); // Never runs


Non-Blocking Code:
Non-blocking code allows other tasks to run while waiting.

Ex:-(Non-Blocking)
setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Hello");
}, 2000);
console.log("Start");
Output: Start, Hello


Blocking vs Non-Blocking:
Blocking waits for a task to finish before moving to the next one.
Non-blocking allows other tasks to run while waiting.

Ex:-
// Non-blocking
setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Task Done");
}, 1000);
console.log("Next Task");

Output: Next Task, Task Done


Why Asynchronous Code is Important?
Async code keeps apps fast and responsive.

Ex:-setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Loading Done");
}, 3000);
console.log("User Can Work");

Output: User Can Work, Loading Done (user doesn't wait for loading)


Real-world Use Cases:
- Fetching data from an API without freezing the UI
- Loading images or files in the background
- Timers and notifications
- Database queries
- File I/O operations


Introduction to Callbacks:
A callback is a function passed to another function to execute later.
This is the foundation of async programming.

Ex:-function fetchData(callback) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    callback("Data loaded");
  }, 2000);
}
fetchData((data) => console.log(data));

Output: Data loaded (after 2 seconds)


Simulate Delayed Greetings (setTimeout)
setTimeout runs code after some delay

Ex:-setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Hello Students!");
}, 2000);


Timing Demo (setTimeout & setInterval)
setTimeout runs once.
setInterval runs repeatedly.

Ex:-setInterval(() => {
  console.log("Tick");
}, 1000);

| Topic        | Key Idea                 |
| ------------ | ------------------------ |
| Sync         | Runs step by step        |
| Async        | Runs in background       |
| Blocking     | Stops execution          |
| Non-blocking | Keeps running            |


📝 Practice Questions

Easy Questions:
1. What is the output of this code?
   console.log("A");
   setTimeout(() => console.log("B"), 0);
   console.log("C");

2. Write code that uses setInterval to count from 1 to 5, logging each number every second.

3. Create a non-blocking function that simulates loading data for 2 seconds.

Medium Questions:
4. Write a function that executes multiple tasks in parallel and waits for all to complete.

5. Create a simple timer that counts down from 10 to 0, logging each number every second.
