Debouncing & Throttling:-
//In web development, certain events (like scroll, resize, or keyup) can trigger rapid and frequent calls to event handlers, potentially leading to performance issues. 
Debouncing and throttling are two techniques used to control the rate at which these functions are executed, ensuring better performance and user experience.

//Debouncing:-
Debouncing ensures that a function is executed only after a specific time has passed since the last time the event was triggered.
Use Case: Searching in a search bar. A user typing rapidly should not trigger a search on every keystroke but only after they pause typing for a short duration.
Example: Waiting 300ms after the last keystroke to perform the search.

Debouncing Implementation
Define a delay time.
Use a timer to reset every time the event is triggered.
Execute the function only if the timer completes without interruption.

let timer;

addEventListener("input", function (event) {
  clearTimeout(timer);
  timer = setTimeout(() => {
    // console.log("The user has called api for thsi number of times");
    searchMovie(event.target.value);
  }, 5000);
});

function searchMovie(query) {
  console.log("Api request " + query);
}
//



//Throttling:-
Throttling ensures that a function is executed at most once in a given interval, regardless of how many times the event is triggered.

Use Case: A resize event when adjusting the browser window. The function executes at regular intervals instead of every millisecond during the resize.
Example: Running a function at most once every 500ms while scrolling.

Throttling Implementation
Define a fixed interval.
Ensure the function runs only once in each interval.

addEventListener("click", buyItem);

let clickButton = true;
function buyItem() {
  if (clickButton) {
    console.log("Button clicked...");

    console.log("Item bought.....");
    clickButton = false;
    setTimeout(() => {
      clickButton = true;
    }, 2000);
  }
}

// Usage Example:
const logScroll = throttle(() => {
  console.log("Scrolling...");
}, 500);
window.addEventListener("scroll", logScroll);
