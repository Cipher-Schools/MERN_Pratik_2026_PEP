Working with JSON and Storing Data Locally:-

Q.What is JSON?
Ans:-
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for both humans to read and machines to parse and generate.
 It is widely used for data exchange between web clients and servers, and it is language-independent, meaning it can be used in almost any programming environment.

Key Characteristics of JSON:
Text-based format: Data is stored as plain text, making it easy to transmit and store.
JavaScript-like syntax: Although JSON is language-independent, its syntax is very similar to JavaScript objects.
Data structure: JSON supports key-value pairs (similar to objects in JavaScript), arrays, and simple data types like strings, numbers, booleans, and null.
JSON Syntax
JSON data is represented as key-value pairs inside curly braces {} (like objects in JavaScript). Arrays are enclosed in square brackets [].
Ex:-
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "age": 30,
  "isStudent": false,
  "courses": ["Math", "Science", "History"],
  "address": {
    "street": "123 Main St",
    "city": "New York"
  }
}

Common Uses of JSON
Data exchange: JSON is used in APIs to exchange data between a client and server.
Configuration files: JSON is often used to store configuration settings.
Storing data locally: JSON is used in localStorage or sessionStorage to store structured data in the browser.

//Converting Data: Using JSON.stringify() and JSON.parse()
JSON.stringify()
The JSON.stringify() function converts a JavaScript object or array into a JSON string. 
This is useful for storing data in formats that require strings, such as localStorage or sending data over the network.
JSON.stringify(object);
Ex:-
const user = {
  name: "Alice",
  age: 25,
  isMember: true
};

// Convert the object to a JSON string
const jsonString = JSON.stringify(user);
console.log(jsonString);
// Output: {"name":"Alice","age":25,"isMember":true}

JSON.parse()
The JSON.parse() function converts a JSON string back into a JavaScript object. 
This is useful when you retrieve data from a string-based storage system (like localStorage) or receive JSON data from a server.
JSON.parse(jsonString);
Ex:-
const jsonString = '{"name": "Alice", "age": 25, "isMember": true}';

// Convert the JSON string back to a JavaScript object
const userObject = JSON.parse(jsonString);
console.log(userObject);
// Output: {name: "Alice", age: 25, isMember: true}

//Handling Nested Objects and Arrays
Both JSON.stringify() and JSON.parse() work seamlessly with nested objects and arrays.

Ex:-
const user = {
  name: "Bob",
  age: 30,
  hobbies: ["reading", "gaming"],
  address: {
    city: "San Francisco",
    state: "CA"
  }
};

// Stringify the object
const jsonString = JSON.stringify(user);
console.log(jsonString);
// Output: {"name":"Bob","age":30,"hobbies":["reading","gaming"],"address":{"city":"San Francisco","state":"CA"}}

// Parse the JSON string back to an object
const parsedObject = JSON.parse(jsonString);
console.log(parsedObject);
// Output: {name: "Bob", age: 30, hobbies: ["reading", "gaming"], address: {city: "San Francisco", state: "CA"}}
