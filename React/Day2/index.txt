Component and Props:-
A React component is essentially a JavaScript function that returns React elements, facilitating the development of complex UIs from simple, reusable pieces.
 Components can range from basic UI elements, like buttons and text, to entire application pages.
 They are defined either as JavaScript functions or classes and are distinguished by their ability to return
  JSX (a syntax extension for JavaScript), which describes the UI structure.
 Props.

Props:-
Props are how components receive data from their parent, enabling them to be dynamic and reusable.
 They are passed to components in a manner similar to function arguments and can include various data types, such as strings, numbers, arrays, objects, and functions. 
 Notably, props are read-only, ensuring a unidirectional data flow that enhances predictability and debugging ease.

Passing Data: Demonstrated by passing different greetings and names to a Greet component.
Read-Only Nature: Props cannot be modified by the component that receives them.
One-Way Data Flow: Props allow data to flow from parent to child components, simplifying data management and component hierarchy.

Ex:-function Greet({ text, name }) {
  return (
    <p>
      {text}, {name}
    </p>
  );
}

const element = (
  <div className="container">
    <Greet text="Happy Birthday" name="Bruce" />
    <Greet text="Good Morning" name="Rachel" />
  </div>
);

// Rendering the element in a React application
const reactRoot = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
reactRoot.render(element);

Activity1:-
Your task is to create a UserProfile component that conditionally renders the user's bio and applies different styling based on the user's role (admin vs user).

Step-by-Step:

Define a UserProfile component accepting user object as props.
Use conditional rendering to display the user's bio only if it's provided.
Apply conditional styling to the user's name, coloring it differently for admins and regular users.



Activity2:-Create a Component: Develop a Card component that accepts title and content as props and displays them.
Nesting Components: Use the Card component within an App component to create a simple page with multiple cards, each displaying different information.
Passing Functions as Props: Create a Button component that accepts a label (string) and an onClick (function) as props.
Use this button within another component and handle its click event to display an alert message.

//State Management in React: Understanding the useState Hook


What is the useState Hook?
useState is a built-in hook in React that allows function components to have their own state. 
It enables the initialization of a state variable and provides a function to update this state. When the state changes,
React automatically re-renders the component to reflect the update. This mechanism is fundamental for creating dynamic and interactive applications.

Advantages of Using useState
Simplicity: Simplifies the state management in functional components, making code more readable and maintainable.
Reusability: Enables the use of state logic across multiple components, promoting code reuse.
Optimization: React optimizes for performance, ensuring minimal re-renders and efficient updates.

Note:-We can not use variables in react directly.
React tracks these values, and when state or props change, it re-renders the component and updates the UI.

Ex:-function App() {
  // Destructuring the array returned by useState
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);

  // Function to increment the count
  const handleClick = () => {
    setCount(count + 1);
  };

  // Rendering the component
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Button is clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={handleClick}>Click Me</button>
    </div>
  );
}

// Rendering the App component into the DOM
const reactRoot = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
reactRoot.render(<App />);

Activity:- Extend the counter app to include a decrement button

//Controlled and Uncontrolled Components in React:-
Controlled Components--->
Controlled components are React components that control the values of input form elements.
 The form data is managed by the React component's state rather than the DOM. Any changes to the input value are handled by a function that updates the component's state, making the React state the "single source of truth."

Benefits:
Synchronization: The input value is always in sync with the component state.
State Management: Easier to integrate with other UI elements or complex state logic.
Validation: Can easily validate user input on-the-fly.
Uncontrolled Components--->
Uncontrolled components, on the other hand, maintain their own state in the DOM.
 React does not have direct control over them, and their values are retrieved through a ref directly from the DOM when needed.

Side Note : We will talk about ref and useRef later in upcoming sessions.
 For now having knowledge of controlled component and understanding the difference between controlled and uncontrolled component should suffice.

Benefits:
Simplicity: Less code is required to set up, as React does not manage the input state.
Integration: Easier to integrate with non-React code that relies on direct DOM manipulation.

Ex:-function App() {
  const [message, setMessage] = React.useState(""); // State for input value

  const handleChange = (event) => {
    setMessage(event.target.value); // Update state based on input
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <input
        value={message}
        onChange={handleChange}
        placeholder="Type a message"
      />
      <p>Your message: {message}</p>
    </div>
  );
}


Ex:-
function App() {
  const [message, setMessage] = React.useState("");

  const handleChange = (event) => {
    setMessage(event.target.value);
  };

  const handleReset = () => {
    setMessage(""); // Resets the message state, thus clearing the input field
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <p>
        Message: <strong>{message}</strong>
      </p>
      <input
        placeholder="Add your message here"
        onChange={handleChange}
        value={message} // Controlled component
      />
      <button onClick={handleReset}>Reset</button>
    </div>
  );
}


Activity:- Implement a form with a controlled <textarea> component that updates its value based on the state.
