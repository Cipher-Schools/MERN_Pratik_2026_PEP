Component Lifecycle in React:-
The lifecycle of React components is an essential concept for developers working with this library.
It refers to the series of events that occur from the moment a component is mounted on the UI until it is unmounted.
Understanding these lifecycle phases is crucial for effectively managing resources, optimizing performance, and ensuring that components behave as expected throughout their existence in the application.

//Lifecycle Phases
A React component's lifecycle can be compared to a person's lifecycle, encompassing birth, life, and death phases, each marked by specific events:

Birth (Mount Phase): This is the phase where the component is created and rendered on the UI for the first time.
It involves initialization and mounting processes.
Life (Update Phase): This phase occurs when there are changes to the component's state or props, which lead to re-rendering.
It's a cycle that can repeat many times as long as the component is displayed.
Death (Unmount Phase): The final phase of a component's lifecycle, this is when the component is removed from the UI, allowing for cleanup activities.

//Events and Event Handlers: A Quick Recap
In React, as in vanilla JavaScript, events are actions or occurrences that happen in the system you are programming, 
which the system tells you about so you can respond to them in some way if desired.
React encapsulates these events and provides its own event handling system which is very similar to handling events on DOM elements.
Here are basic examples of event and event handler in JavaScript:

//Event: An action or occurrence, e.g., a button click, window load.
Event Handler: A function that is triggered in response to an event, e.g., a function that runs when a button is clicked.

//Side Effects, useEffect and Mount Phase:-
In modern web development, React has become a cornerstone for building interactive user interfaces.
Among its features, the useEffect hook is a powerful tool for managing side effects in functional components.
This lesson dives into the useEffect hook, explaining its syntax, usage, and practical applications,
especially in handling network requests and updating the DOM after the component mounts.


SideEffects:-
Side effects are tasks that are performed outside the normal rendering of a component.
These are not directly dependents on the function.
They run in the background even if the function does not exists.

Ex:-
Fetching data from an API (server calls)
Updating the browser tab title using document.title
Setting timers using setTimeout or setInterval
Adding event listeners (click, scroll, resize)
Storing data in Local Storage
Making WebSocket or real-time connections
Directly modifying the DOM
Subscribing and unsubscribing to services

Note:-API calls, timers, browser updates, and storage operations are common side effects in React.

//Side effects can be handled efficiently at a single place using a special hook called useEffect.
