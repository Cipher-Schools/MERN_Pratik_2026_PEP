Introduction to DOM :
Introduction
The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents.
 It represents the structure of HTML and XML documents as a tree where each node represents a part of the document.
Understanding DOM is crucial for web development as it allows dynamic manipulation of web pages,
 enabling interactive user experiences and dynamic content updates without reloading the entire page.

Detailed Explanation:-

What is the concept?
The DOM is a cross-platform and language-independent interface that treats an HTML or XML document as a tree structure consisting of nodes. 
Each node represents an element, attribute, or piece of text in the document.
Why is it useful?
DOM enables developers to access, modify, and manipulate the content, structure, and style of web documents dynamically using programming languages like JavaScript. 
This capability is essential for creating interactive web applications and enhancing user experience.
Real-world examples or analogies

Think of the DOM as a blueprint of a house.
 Each element (node) in the DOM tree represents a room (HTML element),
  and developers can rearrange or modify the rooms (elements) as needed without rebuilding the entire house (web page).

 Document node:-Refers to the doc type
 Element node:-It refers to the html tags
 Text Node:-Represents the text inside the tag
 Attribute node:-It represnts the attributes given to any tag.
 Comment node:-Refers to the comments inside the html


Accessing Dom Elements:-
// Returns a reference to the element by its ID.
document.getElementById("someid");

// Returns an array-like object of all child elements which have all of the given class names.
document.getElementsByClassName("someclass");

// Returns an HTMLCollection of elements with the given tag name.
document.getElementsByTagName("LI");

// Returns the first element within the document that matches the specified group of selectors.
document.querySelector(".someclass");

// Returns a list of the elements within the document (using depth-first pre-order traversal of the document's nodes)
// that match the specified group of selectors.
document.querySelectorAll("div.note, div.alert");

//when using query selector , we have to rely same as of old way as style in html.
//It will give the first matching element

Note:- On html collection you can not run any higher order function on it 
       on a node list you can run a HOF and i.e only forEach
       HTML collection remains live and not node list , when ever dom updates  HTML collection also updates  not node list


  let div = document.getElementById("parent");
  console.log(div.innerText);

  let p = document.getElementsByClassName("pTag");
  console.log(p);
  let tag = document.getElementsByTagName("p");
  console.log(tag);

  let ans = document.querySelector(".pTag");
  console.log(ans);

  let res = document.querySelectorAll(".pTag");
  console.log(res);
